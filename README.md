# Escaping Ice

Game project for Game Jam [GDL - August 2022 Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gdl-august-2022-jam), the theme of which was "Death is not the end... Death is progress."
It seemed to me funny that the role of the main character was ice, which would run away from the bartender, so as not to be in the next alcoholic cocktail again), and leaves behind a puddle, sliding on which followers will travel a greater distance than their predecessors.

I didn’t find a team, so even during the game jam I lost one day due to personal circumstances, so I didn’t have time to finish the game during the jam

After the event, I decided to slightly correct the project, and leave it as a reminder
